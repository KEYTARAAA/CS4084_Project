# CS4084_Project
The purpose f this app is to be a fitness buddy and to keep you motivated while on your journey to fitness
It does this by giving you different tools that you can use to workout with (eg a run tracker or interval training timer)
It also allows you to make posts and view your friends posts so that you can help to keep each other motivated.
You can share your own fitness journey by sharing your workouts, experiences and pictures on your profile.

## Getting Started:
You can make your own new account by:
*Accepting the permissions asked by the app

*Following the account set up instructions


but for the purposes of having friends and seeing your friends posts and notifications we have made a sample account for you with these already in place

This will let you see your friends posts and view a friend request


In the app there is 5 main pages being the settings, search , news feed, notifications and profile

Setttings:
The settings tab will allow you to; change your Bio or Password, start an interval trainig session, go on a tracked run.

Interval Training:
This lets you set a sprint and rest time for as many rounds as you want. 
It will vibrate in different patterns to alert you that it is a sprint time, rest time or it is finished.
It is intended to give you a timed workout and timed rest for the number of rounds you want eg 3 30 second plank with 10 second breaks between them.

This will track your run , time and highlight your route.
After pressing finish it will take you to a screen that will show a screenshot of your rout and some statistics like what time you reached each milestone.
